mplib testsuite README file
===============================================================================

This package provides a testsuite written in C for helping developing
mplib. Don't excpect nice code or some cleverness, its just my prop to
test the features of my current mplib build. Feel free to extend this
programm if you like to develop.

To build do the following:
./configure --enable-build-dir=/your/path/mplib/src

Then 'cd src' and start run the programm for some standard tests.
You may also scan directory trees and verify if mplib works correctly
on these files. Use the -s path option for that.
